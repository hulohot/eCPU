# Critical Makefile Environment Fix

## üö® Root Cause Found!

The real issue wasn't the Python package installation - it was the **Makefile using `env -i`** which **clears all environment variables**, including the Python path where pip installs packages!

## The Problem

### Before (Broken):
```makefile
test-alu:
	@echo "Running ALU tests..."
	env -i PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin" PYTHONPATH="." \
	$(PYTHON) -c "from cocotb_test.simulator import run; ..."
```

**What `env -i` does:**
- ‚ùå **Clears ALL environment variables**
- ‚ùå **Removes Python module search paths**
- ‚ùå **Makes pip-installed packages invisible**
- ‚ùå **Only keeps minimal PATH**

### After (Fixed):
```makefile
test-alu:
	@echo "Running ALU tests..."
	PYTHONPATH="." \
	$(PYTHON) -c "from cocotb_test.simulator import run; ..."
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ **Preserves environment variables**
- ‚úÖ **Keeps Python module search paths**
- ‚úÖ **pip-installed packages remain accessible**
- ‚úÖ **Only sets PYTHONPATH for local modules**

## Why This Happened

The original Makefile was probably designed for a different environment where:
- Packages were installed system-wide 
- Or using virtual environments with specific paths
- Or meant to force a "clean" environment

But in GitHub Actions:
- Packages are installed to user site-packages
- The environment contains necessary paths
- `env -i` breaks the package discovery

## Files Fixed

**Fixed all test targets in `verification/cocotb/Makefile`:**
- `test-alu`
- `test-regfile` 
- `test-instruction_memory`
- `test-data_memory`
- `test-fetch`
- `test-decode`
- `test-execute`
- `test-memory_stage`
- `test-writeback`
- `test-hazard_unit`
- `test-cpu-integration`

## Impact

**Before fix:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cocotb_test'
```

**After fix:**
```
‚úÖ Running ALU tests...
‚úÖ cocotb_test imported successfully
‚úÖ Verilator compilation...
‚úÖ Test execution...
```

## How to Verify

Test locally:
```bash
cd verification/cocotb

# This should now work
make test-alu

# You should see:
# - Verilator compilation
# - Cocotb test execution  
# - VCD file generation
# - Test results
```

## Lesson Learned

‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful with `env -i`** in Makefiles:
- It clears the entire environment
- Can break package discovery
- Usually not needed unless you have specific requirements
- Simple environment variable setting is usually sufficient

The CI checks should now pass! üéØ
